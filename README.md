# labware_scale

This is for the Accuris W3300 Series of balances.

## Scale configuration:

 - the baud rate of the scale need to be changed because the particle photon cannot communicate at the default rate (300 is too low for the photon). Suggestion is to instead switch to a BAUD rate of 4800 in the scale configuration (see manual for details on how to adjust this).
